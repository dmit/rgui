# rgui

A basic terminal GUI for searching text files.

```
$ rgui <PATTERN> <PATH...>
```

## TODO

- [ ] Toggle for case insensitive search.
- [ ] Toggle for plain text (non-regex) search.
- [ ] Progress marker for when a search is ongoing.
- [ ] Basic edit controls on the pattern field (move cursor left/right, select all, etc).
- [ ] Navigation of results and, possibly, ability to launch `$EDITOR` on files at the line where the currently selected match was found.
- [ ] Restore previous console state after quitting instead of clearing the screen.
- [ ] A `--help` flag?
